Inline elements are those which take only this much width as required. And block elements are those which take the full width of the screen. This is also called display property which can be set through CSS. If you are enjoying this video so far, then do like this video. So let's go to the computer screen and see inline and block elements closely through some very good examples. Let's roll the intro. So guys, now the time has come to see inline and block elements. If you haven't accessed the playlist and haven't accessed the code, then access both. Because as the videos are being made, the code of the videos and our video is being added in the playlist. Now what I will do here quickly, which I always do, I will make a folder here in the name of video 8. So I have already put 7 videos here by doing new folder. I will make a video 8 here and open it in VS Code. After opening it in VS Code, what I will do is I will make index.html and tell you about index and block element. So I hit the exclamation mark and hit enter. And I could have typed this too, but I won't do it because why type when I can do this. And I will write here inline and block elements. I told you a little bit about this. But I will tell you more about it by putting more light on it. What are inline elements and why I would like to use them. So see inline elements are those elements which take only this much width as required. Do block elements take only this much width? No, they say we need full width. They say that our width is full. Some people sit spread out. These block elements are like that. I tell you what the difference is. And to explain this difference, I will cheat a little bit here. And what is cheating is that I will add CSS. You will say that CSS is not read, why are you adding CSS? Oh, I am adding CSS, just as much as it is necessary. And here I will do one thing that my P is here. I will write P, hit enter and here I will write let us say Hey, I am a para. And I will say here that give background color to P. Let us say blue. I will give you a good one. So you guys choose the color well. What is going on here? Now you can see here that I have given a color to paragraph. And along with that, what will I do? I will put an anchor tag. href is equal to will be google.com. Let us say I have to put https. Then it will go to google.com. And I will write google here. And do you know what I will give the background color of the anchor tag? I will give the background color red. But not red, I will hover here. And in this way, I can choose any color in the spectrum. How did you like this ninja tagging? Tell me in the comment section below. If you already knew ninja tagging, then comment. I am already a ninja. Okay, so here. Do comment on this, guys. This is very important. Now here you can see the background color. I gave this of the anchor tag. And I made it very similar. I change it a little. I make it reddish. I made it a little red orange. And I made it blue. Now you see the difference. I will click here. And as soon as I click here, you see. The background color that he got, he got the full width. But he got only as much as this element is. Why did this happen? This happened because this is the paragraph block element. And our anchor tag is the inline element. Inline elements only take the place they want. Block elements take the full width. And the next content comes below them. When we take the full width, the next content will come below them. Along with that, if I talk about div, what is that too? A block element. I am a block element. And span is there. Which is exactly like div. But it is an inline element. I am span and I am inline. Okay, and after that, if I put an anchor tag. And write yes he is inline. So you see here. What happened? I will show you the code by zooming out. So if I write it in the new line too. By the way, I will tell you how many spaces I will give here. This will not be added in my content. Because HTML is more than one space. It does not include it anyway. If you have to give spaces, then you can either write ampersand nbsp. I will tell you about it. But now I want to show you how it is working. So see what happened? I wrote here, hey I am a paragraph. What is paragraph? A block element. So he took the full width. The next content will come below. I wrote href is equal to. So it only took the width as much as it is necessary. And it only took this much width. But the next content was saying that I need the full width. So it will not come here. It will come in the next line. Because he says that I need the full width. So it will come in the next line. It cannot come in this line. Because if it comes in this line, then how will it take the full width? Google is also taking the width. So it will take the full width. If I give it a background color, then it will be visible in the full width. Let's do one thing, let's give it a yellow color. Let's give it a background color. And I give our background color yellow. And you see here, it took the full width. Along with that, I can keep the span and anchor tag in the same line. Because it is an inline element. So inline elements only take the width as much as it is necessary. And it also gives the opportunity for other elements to come in its width. Like you saw here that this span also gave the opportunity for anchor tag to come. Now will the anchor tag always be inline? Will the paragraph tag always be blocked? Will this thing always be there? The answer is no. You can change it. You can set the display property of any particular element from CSS. And if you have set the display property, then it is not necessary that it will remain inline. It can also be blocked. And the block element will remain blocked. It can also be inline. We will see this in CSS later. Now I would like to pinpoint one thing quickly. That the video of forms was video 7. But I put it in the folder named video 6. So I will make it video 7. And now it is video 8. Okay, what we are doing now is video 8. And there is nothing in video 7. So I will also quickly structure it here. You don't worry about it at all. I hope you are getting good learnings. Many people have pointed this thing in the comments. I will fix it. But I think that doesn't affect us in any way. Because you guys are understanding. And now the folder you will get of the source code, you will get it right. Along with that, go to codewithari.com, click on notes and download the notes. And it will be a complimentary source for you. But I am explaining everything here. Step by step, so you don't worry about it at all. Okay, so this is about our inline and block elements. Now which elements are inline, which blocks are there, how will you know that? How will you know that div is a block and span is inline? So this comes with practice. But I have made a comprehensive list for you. Inline and block elements. Here is the list of block elements. In which I have written the most commonly used elements first. Like div is the most used. Then paragraph is there. And if you come to the end, you will get such elements. Which may not be very used. Maybe you don't even know about them. But you will know later. And it is not possible for me to tell all the elements here. So you guys do some self-learning too. Definitely there are many such elements. Which you will come to use very little. But the most commonly used ones will be shown to you. Then I have made a complete list of inline elements below. So you refer this comprehensive list. Here I have made a file called comprehensivelist.txt. So you refer this file. Along with that, the code you have, there should not be any unnecessary space in it. As I was telling you that there is no space in it. In fact, if you write the format by right-clicking, then your document will be formatted. Write the code well. Write the code in such a way that when your grandchildren open your laptop. And if they get this code, they will say that grandfather used to write good code. Don't say that grandfather used to put such a space. Then grandfather used to do this like this. He used to do this. So you will want to be remembered in good words. So write your code well. So that your grandchildren tell you very good things. Now here through the html comments, I want to give you a quiz. And what is this quiz? Without using br tag, write a vertically aligned form asking for name city. And here I have added one more thing. I will show you. I will turn on the word wrap. Now see here, the name city and pin code of a user. So you have to write a form. Because in the last video we read about the form. You have to write this form. How will you make it? You should know. And along with that, I want everyone in the comment section to answer this quiz. Everyone. This is our first quiz. So I want you to make a two-way interaction. Write your code in the comment section. And tell me which element did you use? If yes, which inline element? Which block element did you use? You can tell me your explanation in the comment section. In the coming videos, we will also see that How can you use CSS to set inline flex, inline block, display properties? And what is the difference in them? So we will see all these things in the coming videos. I want to tell you that if you are following this course, Then you are going to be a very good web developer. And you don't think that the videos are long and our hustle is going on for a long time. And so on. I want courses to be beginner-friendly. Whatever course I am making. And along with that, I would like to tell you that people will tell you in life. That you are doing this, we are having fun, you are studying, you are doing this, you are doing that. Do you know what is the thing that people will never tell you? That is, you are blessed. No one will tell you that you got a Sigma web development course. You are living at a time when you are getting such a good comprehensive course for free in Hindi. No one will tell you that you are blessed. People will tell you that I am going to watch a movie, I am going to see this. You are studying, what is it? You are so boring. People will tell you this. But no one will tell you that you are blessed to find this course. You are blessed that you are watching. You are blessed that you are not getting distracted. And when you look back in the future, you will realize it yourself. That how blessed I am. I myself say that how blessed I am that I studied at the time of IIT JEE. I took out IIT JEE, so much happened. All things changed. So no one will tell you this. No one will tell you that it is worth the sacrifice that you are doing. I am telling you that all the people who have got success in life, they have sacrificed. Take anyone's name. They have sacrificed somewhere. And people will never tell you that this sacrifice is worth it. So you guys keep working hard. You are going right. Don't think that we are missing this, we are missing that. All things happen. I should have got 4-5 hundred rupees note for this advice. Which I did not get. But no problem, let's move on. Here I will do one thing quickly. I will add a color in the span. So I will write span here. And I will put the background color here. I will put any color. I will put blue violet. I will reduce it a little. I will click and hover here. Like this. And now you will see here. So see, it has highlighted it like this. So that's all for this video. I hope you guys understood what is the difference between inline and block elements. Access the playlist. Like the video. Please also access the code. Give your village land to me. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Music."}
