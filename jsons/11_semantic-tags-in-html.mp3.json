    "text": " What's up guys, you are in the 11th video of the Sigma Web Development course. We have completed 10 videos. So one like is enough for the consistency of all of us. In today's video, we will see about Semantic Tags. Because they are very important for SEO. And to understand the structure of the overall website, search engines are very happy to see this structure. That is, overall SEO of your website is going to be very good if you use these tags. What are these tags? Why are these tags? How to use them? What are the benefits? We will see in this video. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, I would like to tell you what are Semantic Tags? Here you can see that I have made a folder named Video 11. And here I have set an index and HTML boilerplate template. I have set an H1 and I am going to preview it by setting this image here. So this is the image. To explain a little, I will tell you what are Semantic Tags? Semantic Tags are for browsers and web crawlers who want to understand your website properly. They tell them what is the content of your website and what is the purpose of which place and which tag. If you do not use Semantic Tags in HTML, then your work will be done. It is not that if you do not use Semantic Tags, then your website will not look good. You can do good designing. But we want to explain to Google and Bing search engines about our website. And if we explain them about our website, then they will be able to understand our website. And they will rank our website on Google, Bing, and respective search engines. And we want the crawlers to understand our website. And we want whoever wants to understand our website, to understand it well. That's why there are some special tags. Like header, nav, main, article, figure. All these special tags are made in HTML which help in structuring your website. Now if there is something in the header, then I know that it is a header. That is, it is at the top. If there is something in the footer, then I will understand that the website has started ending from here. This footer started here. This footer could also be div. But no, if I am using Semantic HTML, then I will use the footer tag. Along with that, where I am in the span tag, I was making my navigation bar. This time I will not make my navigation bar in the span tag. I will make my navigation bar in the nav tag. So these kinds of differences explain our search engines very well about what our website is about. Okay. So I will show you some examples of semantic tags here. And I hope you understood what semantic tags are. Now see, there are download folders like our computer. Many of you must have a download folder that I don't know, all the files in the world have come in it. 90% of the files in your computer are in the download folder of many people. But we should not do this. Some people go to such an extent that they start spreading files in their local disk C, in the windows folder. And some people keep files in system 32 too. So if you spread your files in your computer, then definitely it is not arranged in one way. But if you arrange it in folders, that you have this file in one folder. If you want to keep a secret file in a folder, you put secret files. You can make a folder called do not open disk. If you can put some of your files in it, then it will be arranged in one way. You have arranged images in one way, you have arranged videos in one way, and let's say you have arranged e-books in one way. So whenever you go to find it, you will get it. So it will be much better for you to understand that folder structure instead of if you are spreading your files throughout the computer. You definitely don't want to spread your files throughout the computer. So I hope you understood this thing that why we use semantic tags. It is very good for our SEO. I have not used the word SEO yet. But SEO, a very important part of search engine optimization is to use semantic tags. So what happens? Basically, I make your website the way you make it. You just use some special tags. For example, let's say I am making this website. What will I do now? I will comment this image here. I will not comment this semantic tag. What I will do here is I will make a navbar. So what I will do? First of all, I will say that this is the header of my website. I have used a header tag. I will make a nav in it. In this, I will make an unordered list. I will make an li in it. And I will write home here. And after this, let's say I am writing a lot like this. And this is my header like this. So anyone who comes to my website will understand that this is my header. Home, about, contact, whatever I want to write, I can write it here. So this is my header, this is my navbar. This is clearly visible because I have used header and nav tags. So I write about here. And I write contact here. So I wrote home here, I wrote about here, and I wrote contact here. So I hope you understood this thing. Now if I want a footer, let's say I want to make a footer. Here my main content will come after the header. So I will use the main tag. And after this, my footer, in footer, let's say I write copyright CWH. And I write here, all rights reserved. Okay, I can write like this. So here, see copyright, all rights reserved, I wrote all this here. Did I, yes, so what I will do is, I will cut this, I will put it in the main, this is my main content. So first my header will come, then main content will come, then footer will come, as you can see here. And here too, you see, here is this header, this is my main content, this is footer. So what I did in one way is, I arranged it. In a way, the way you arrange your files, in different folders, I arranged my HTML tags here. So we understood about the header tag, that it is used to represent the top section of a webpage, which is the header. Then after this, we put nav, which is in the navigation menu on our page, so we will put that in the nav tag, ideally. Article indicates a self-containing piece of content, such as blog post or news article. If you put a particular self-contained piece of content, then put it in the article tag. Section represents a thematic grouping. That is, suppose one section is talking about one thing of your page, then the other section will talk about something else. Aside, aside means if anything is on the side, then it uses the aside tag. So here, see, typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the main content. Like what you can do on the aside tag, that you have to put a side note, you have to put about the author, you must have seen many blogs, in which side is also written about the author. So you can put such things from the aside tag. Then after this we have the footer tag. I told you about it. If you want to put copyright information, or if you want to put some important links of the website, then you can put that in the footer. Then after this, figure and fig caption. What is figure and fig caption? Whenever you want to use images, diagrams, charts, you can use figure and fig caption. In the main, the main content area, like the main content area of our page was this, we put it in the main tag. Then there is also a time tag, which is time related information. So you can use the time tag, you can put date, time or anything in it. So I hope you understood this thing. So these are used to enhance SEO, to improve accessibility. And if the browser wants to take a decision about any of our page, let's say there is a browser, it has a new feature, that it will read our content aloud. Like there is a feature in the edge. So the browser can decide that read aloud is being done. Now think about it, if someone wants to read aloud this page, then how will he read aloud? You don't want to read aloud like this. You want the main content to be read. HTML, semantic tags, HTML5 introduced, arrange, semantic tags and so on. The first versions of our HTML, they did not have semantic tags. Semantic tags were introduced from HTML5. And the most important reason to introduce semantic tags in HTML5 is to arrange things. So that the browser or the content that is being parsed, which is also looking at the code of our content, whether it is a browser, crawler, Google, Bing, search engines, or anyone wants to generate a preview, like you put a URL on Twitter, so it wants to generate a preview. If there are such things, then you will want your content to be understood well. So if you want your content to be understood well, then you will use semantic tags. Here this image is explaining very well that if you write HTML without semantic tags, then you will write like this with semantic tags. This image you are seeing, this is a header, this is a nav, this is a side. How to throw one thing aside, we will do all this with CSS. Don't be confused, this is not used for styling. Because many people are confused that aside tag is used to aside things. No, it is not at all. You will have to style things with CSS. But here your content can be understood well. Describe which is the main content, which is the header, which is the footer. That's why semantic tags are made. So semantic tags do not do any magic. Semantic tags are made only for accessibility and to understand your page. Now there are some examples here, which you can see. I have given an example of header and footer tag. What will happen inside the header? Here you see that you will ideally put your navigation bar inside the header and then style it with CSS. I will show you a very quick styling. But many people will be confused that how will this navigation bar be horizontal. So if you want to make the navigation bar horizontal, then I will write some CSS here. And I will tell you why CSS works here. So you see, I have flexed the display. So it happened like this. So a lot is going to happen in the coming videos. So don't worry at all about this. We didn't do this, we didn't do that. I will tell you everything. And what does this CSS mean here? Why did I write CSS by inspecting? I will tell you, I will reload, it went. Why did it go? We are going to see all this in the CSS section. If you have not accessed this playlist yet, then do it. Bookmark the accesses. Click here and save it. And I am uploading all the code. So as you move forward in the videos, you will get all the code here video wise. Do start this repository if you have not done it yet. And also like the video. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
