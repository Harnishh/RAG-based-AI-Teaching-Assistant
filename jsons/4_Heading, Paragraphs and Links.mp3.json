If you have found this course awesome till now, then do like this video. Your likes will help me in bringing such free courses. In this video, we will make a small project which will be a bookmark website. This bookmark website will help you to bring all your favorite websites in one place. And you will be able to use it in actual. So let's start quickly. Write down in the comment quickly, Sigma Batch OP. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, as you can see, I have come inside my computer screen. And if you have not accessed the playlist yet, then you can access it. One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to GitHub.com slash code with Ari, you will get the GitHub repo of the Sigma Web Dev course. Now I have made folders for all the videos in it. And the commit is also made according to different folders. So you will get it. So you must access it so that you get the source code. I will also put the source code of the video in the description. So there is nothing to worry about. Now we will make a very basic website today. But it will be very important for us because it will be our first useful website. So without taking much time, I will make a new folder in this folder of Sigma Web Dev. And I will name it video 4 because it is our fourth video. So I will make it with the name video 4. I will click on Open with Code by right-clicking on the shift key. So that this folder opens in our VS Code. After doing this, I will do the same thing that we have always done. index.html, main.css, style.css and script.js We usually make these three files. If I write CSS, I will put it here. If I write script, I will put it here. But for now, I will write an exclamation mark here and write it in the document. My bookmarks. Okay, so we are going to make a bookmark website. And I will write code with Ari here. So you must have seen such titles. Now I will write h1 here. Now what happens with h1? You can put a heading from h1 on your web page. We talked about the basic structure. We said that this tells that this is an HTML page. HTML lang is equal to en. Lang is an attribute and its value is en. That is, the content of this page is in English. This tells the search engines. Or if anyone is sitting with the link of this web page, then he will know that this web page is in English. Accordingly, he can parse this web page. The browser will also know that your web page is in English. Now here is this head in which metadata, which title of the page, which CSS is linked. All these things are information. The main content is inside the body. Now there is a tag inside the body to put a heading. Its name is h1. And I am going to write my bookmarks on it. So if I write my bookmarks here, then we will write it with h1 tag. And if I want to do it live here, I will click here and after that I will open it in the browser. So see this is how my bookmarks are visible. Now why should we always use h1? Why didn't I write my bookmark directly? Because I am telling the browser that this is my heading. And this is my first level heading. Now suppose I want to keep two types of bookmarks in my bookmarks. One main bookmark and one secondary bookmark. So I will use h2, that is, the second level heading. So I will write here. If you have used Microsoft Word, then you will know what h1 and h2 are. But if you don't know, then I will tell you. h1 is your main level heading. And after that, the second level heading is from h2. Suppose I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks. Suppose I do something like this. And here I will press Alt, Shift and Down Arrow. I will do one thing, why don't I turn on screencast mode? So what I did here is, I pressed Alt, Shift and Down Arrow, so this is replicated. This is a shortcut of VS Code. I would like to tell you one more shortcut of VS Code. If you press Alt on your keyboard, and then wherever you click, a cursor will be created there. Suppose I click here, then only one cursor will come. But if I press Alt and click somewhere else, then the cursor will come there. Suppose I want to make all bookmarks code with Harry. So my bookmarks dash code with Harry. I can write something like this. How did I do this? I clicked here, then I pressed Alt. And wherever I click by pressing Alt, I will get multiple cursors there. Then whatever I type will come in multiple cursors. Wherever there are cursors, whatever I type there will be visible. Isn't it interesting? Like it. So I will remove it here in this way. And you see, it will be updated. So this is my main heading. This is my h2. Similarly, from h1 to h2, we have heading up to h6. Like suppose you gave a main heading. After the main heading, you gave a secondary heading. Then after that, you had to give some heading inside it. And so on. You had to give a lot of subheadings. Then you can give heading up to h6. h6 is more than enough. In HTML, there are headings up to h6. You will never need h7. If we talk about practical life. And if you have to, you can use h6 repeatedly. Because it becomes so small after h1. That h6 will become very small. You don't want it to be so small. Now what I will do here. I will replicate it with Alt Shift Down Arrow. And I will click here. I will press Alt. I am telling you all these shortcuts. So that your productivity increases. Now I have put two cursors here and here. I will press backspace and make it h3. Then I will click here. I will press Alt. I will click here. I will make it h4. Okay. And I will click here. I will click here. I will make it h5. Okay. After this, I will click here. I will click here. I will make it h6. So it is up to h6. Now what I will do. I will write here using h1. So that you know. And I will write using here at least. I will press space. I will write using. I will write h. And now my work is left here. By clicking, just write 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. And you see, it is looking something like this. So you know that h1 is like this. h2 is like this. h3 is so small. h4 is so small. h5 is so small. h6 is so small. And what will happen if h6 is smaller than h1. It will end at some point. So h6 is more than enough. So I will show you a practical demonstration of this. For example, this is my html tutorial. So here I have given the main heading. html introduction. After this, I have given the word as html. Then I have given the features of html. I gave this from h1. I gave this from h2. After that, something came in h2. So I gave it from h3. There is something in it too. Like here, why the term hypertext and markup language was. This is heading 2. What is the main heading page? html introduction. After this, this is subheading. I had to give a quick exercise in this too. So I used h3 in it too. Then it came back to h2. Because it was in it. So in building the hierarchy, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 are used. Okay. I hope you guys understood. Many people are commenting that you are starting very slow. That's why we know. So I am running this course as a beginner course. When I tell you html, then you will say a little bit. Yes, this is very easy. Then I will tell you a little csl. Yes, this also comes. Then I will say JavaScript. You will say yes, it comes a little bit. Then I will say bootstrap. Then you will say yes, this too. It will happen, there is a little problem. Then I will say react. You will say what is happening? Then assume nodejs. Okay. Then after that, I take things to MongoDB MySQL. Then after that, at a time, the level will go up so much. I said, we will raise the bar like anything. This is what I meant. So when we will do react, when I will make projects there, when we will do dangerous things, then I will ask for their comment below. Brother, tell me what is the level? Okay. So don't talk about the level. The level is going to rise. Very well. So these are our headings. 6 headings which I would like to keep like this. Now if we want to write a paragraph, then you can use p tag. If you hit p enter, this paragraph will come. Now I will tell you a shortcut trick. If you want to bring a dummy paragraph in VS Code through Emmet, then what will you do? You will write lorem here. Assume I wrote lorem 23. And see here, Emmet abbreviation has come of lorem 23. It will give me 23 words. Something like this. You can click on view and wrap the word. Then you will not get a horizontal scroll bar. So wrap this view word. Now you see here, lorem, ipsum, dollars, sit, here a dummy text has come. Why do we want dummy text sometimes? Because we want it because we are making a template. And we have to fill that template with something. Assume you are making a website which looks like OYO rooms. Okay. Now here OYO, become a member, OYO for business, Assume I don't have to write all this here. I have written lorem here. Now I have to write something here. So I will write lorem here. Assume I have to write 7 words. I will write lorem 7 and hit enter. Then I will give it to OYO people. They will do whatever they want to write. Okay. So here you use it to fill the placeholder. Okay. My plan is that we will also make popular website clones. So that you will know how things work. This is also a very popular website. If you have used their services, then do tell us in the comment section below. Now we will see more things ahead. Like here is a paragraph. How do you have to style it? And all these things are done through CSS. Now look at the paragraph here. When I wrote lorem 23, so much text came. Now I will hit p enter here. Assume I write lorem 10 here. Only 10 words will come. Okay. And if I want to write lorem 100. My page will be very full. So I can do that too. So this lorem trick is very good. You will enjoy it. And whenever we make a popular website clone. Assume I make a clone of amazon.in. Okay. I make a clone of amazon.in. So assume I have to write something here. Okay. Now I can't see so much text here. Assume I have to write 3 words here. So I will write lorem 3. I will not think about makeup products. I will write lorem 4 here. I will write lorem 3 here. I will write lorem 2. And make a template and get it ready. And whatever is there after that. It will come in my database too. And in a very different way. I can bring my in-text. Many people asked. Will this course be job ready? The answer is yes. This course is going to be job ready. Absolutely. I will make you so. That you will be able to do industry level jobs. Through the learning of this course. Now let's talk about. What are the attributes in HTML? These are the attributes in HTML. Like I used the HTML tag. Lang is equal to en. Lang is an attribute. We did not use any attribute in the body. We did not use any attribute in h1. We did not use any attribute in p. But I can use a style attribute in p. Which is also called inline CSS. If I make the background color red here. Okay, something like this. So its background color will be red. This is also called inline CSS. Through style attribute. So if you put style is equal to CSS. First we learned to put CSS here. But if you put style is equal to. Then you will get this background red here. Let me show you. You got this red background. Okay. I will make this teal. Or I will do this. This is a good color. So I can also put style inline. But when you make industry level websites. We use inline styles very less. Because the maintainability is reduced. Reusability is reduced. Okay. So we want to ship a small bundle on the browser. And our website is more and more optimized. That's why we avoid all these things. But inline CSS has a style tag. But here style is an attribute. P is a tag. P tag has an attribute style. Through this we can style this element. We will also learn about many other attributes. Attributes basically give an element. Enhanced functionality. Like we gave a style to this paragraph. Which was background color thistle. To give this background color. We used style attribute. In the same way to give properties. To any tag or any element. We use this kind of attributes. Like if we talk. We talked about link. Link colon CSS. Link has a relic attribute. Href attribute. So what can we do with this attribute? We can put this CSS style sheet. Like let's say background. Background color. I say body first. Okay. What do we want in the body? Background color. And you don't have to worry about it. Don't worry at all about it. How is all this happening? Because all this will be told in CSS. But I am just telling you. Let's say I do hot pink. Okay. Listen to another functionality of VS Code. This ninja technique will be very useful. Here hover the mouse. And here you can choose any color you want. Around it. Like this. If I leave it. And do this. So you see here. The background color of my body is this. How did you like the ninja technique? Write in the comment. Ninja technique. It looks good. Okay. Now here. We have come back to index.html. I can remove it if I want. If I comment it out. Then this style sheet will not be there. Which is very natural. The background color was coming from this style sheet. It was removed. This background color was coming from inline CSS. So it didn't remove it. Which is very natural. Okay. It is very normal. Here I did this style is equal to background color. Because of which its background color was visible. Now we are going to make a bookmark. We are going to make a bookmark manager. Bookmark manager dot html. And I am making it a separate file. Because here I have told you different types of headings. I am going to make a useful bookmark manager. So I will write here. Bookmark manager. Now you will say. In Chrome, there is a bookmark manager. Why are you making it? This is made by our hands. This will be our own child. We made it. So you will have a different love for it. Because you made it yourself. Someone made a software. You bought it from somewhere. You made a software yourself. So the software you made yourself. That's a different story. Okay. Now here you can see. Bookmark manager code is written here. I will write h1 here. And I will write my bookmarks. Okay. I wrote my bookmarks. Now I will write h2 after this. I will write primary bookmarks here. And after this I will write secondary bookmarks from h2. Okay. In fact, if I do alt shift bottom space here. I will write secondary bookmarks here. So what will happen? I can put secondary bookmarks here. Now what I will do? I will write Google in a paragraph. Or I write it like this. Google. Okay. We will write it from the list. But in the coming videos, I will tell you. How to use the list. For now, you understand like this. Google. Suppose I write Google here. Open Google. And what I will do here? I will use anchor tag. So as soon as I hit enter in A. A has a mandatory attribute. href. href means to click and go to which link. So href is equal to I will write. https://www.google.com Will be sent to this address. Whenever someone clicks on Open Google. And this Open Google. I will cut it and put it here. That is, the content of the stack will remain like this. And here you can see. A href is equal to this. Open Google has come. This is called anchor tag. Which helps us make links. You must have seen a lot of such links. Now you see here. That as soon as I. I will go to bookmarkmanager.html. You can see here. That this way you can see all the bookmarks. Open Google. Now if I click on it, Google will open. You can see. Now you noticed one thing. When I did not click on it. Then its color was blue. Now I visited it. So its color has changed. So its color changes. When you visit it. That is, it has been converted into a visited link. So I know that. I have visited it. Now I tell you one more thing. That here. If we want it to open in a new tab. Like I am clicking on it. So it is opening in the same tab. If you want to open it in a new tab. Then you have two ways. Either you have your mouse wheel. This one. This mouse wheel. You can click on it like this. Now I tell you another way. If you want. If someone clicks. Then it opens in a new tab. Then you can use an attribute. You can write here. That target is equal to underscore blank. And VS Code gives you suggestions. So I wrote it by hitting two enters. Write it in notepad. Write it in any other cheap editor. So what happens to you? Means according to quality. Free is VS Code. But according to quality. If you use a cheap editor. Then target is equal to underscore blank. You have to type it all. It hurts a little. But if you write it in any way. And what will happen now? Now I will click on it. I am clicking. I am not clicking the mouse wheel. I am clicking. I will click. It came to the new tab. Okay. If I click the mouse wheel. Then it will open in the new tab. So I can open it like this. Now I have written a very simple. Open Google. If you want. Then your favorite website. Whichever website is your favorite. You can put it here. Okay. I have put good websites. Friends. Okay. Now I will write here. Open Facebook. And here you see. www.facebook.com And let's say I write here. Quora.com And codewithhari.com And after this we put here. Let us say. Which website should I put? Youtube.com Let's see. Whether it came here or not. You have seen one thing. It is coming in the same line. Okay. If you want it to not come in one line. So what will you do? You will put them in your paragraphs. This is a very dirty way. Why I am saying it dirty way. I will tell you later. But you enclose it in a paragraph. If you want. And I will press shift. I will press right arrow. I will do ctrl x. After this I will press end. All the cursors will go to the end. Because if you press end on one cursor. Then they go to the end. And after this I will do ctrl v. Now I have used this shortcut a lot. And many of you will be like this. What did you do? If you are a beginner. But what I simply did. That I used the functionality of VS Code. Multiple cursor functionality. I have brought multiple cursors by pressing alt. And after that I used it. Ideally this is not a good way. By using paragraphs. We never make lists. We make lists by using lists. But because we have not read the list. So we are using paragraphs. But this will do our work. It will look something like this. And what we have not visited. See it is blue. Visited Facebook. Its color also became purple. Visited Quora. Its color also became purple. So now these are your primary bookmarks. What will be your secondary bookmarks? We put two secondary bookmarks. Suppose your secondary bookmarks are those. Which you visit sometimes. Follow wikipedia.com. Wikipedia.com has come here. And suppose stackoverflow.com. We will write the spelling correctly. Stackoverflow. Let's capitalise Stackoverflow. And now you see here in secondary bookmarks. Your Wikipedia and Stackoverflow has come. So this has become your bookmark manager. And you can make this bookmark manager even better. We will learn styling from CSS. So if you see this ugly. So don't take tension. Don't say that this looks very ugly. Don't take tension about it at all. Because we will do styling in the coming time. We will do designing. We will talk about all those things. For now your bookmark looks like this. Bookmark manager code with area is your title. And I will write it in H1. So both will be same. Our title and H1. That is, our title will be the same. My bookmarks code with area will be written here too. So this way you can make a bookmark manager. You can actually use it. Now if you save it in this way. Like my bookmark manager.html. You can copy it and put it on your desktop if you want. Then whenever you want to open a website. You just double click it. It will open. If suppose it opens by double clicking VS code. So what you have to do. You have to right click and open with. You have to choose another app. And then after choosing Google Chrome. You have to do always. So I will choose Google Chrome. And I will do always here. So whenever I double click it. It will open from Google Chrome. So this was our bookmark manager. I hope you liked it. I have a request from you. Today our 4 videos are complete. So if you liked this course. I want you to share it with your friends. I know very few people will share. But if you do. Then I get a lot of courage. And I will try to bring more courses like this. A lot of people are shocked. And they are saying that how is this course free. What is the benefit of you. How will you earn. I will find some other ways to make more money. But the thing is. That I am going to mark this course. That this is the best course of web development. With everything. I mean I will put everything in it. And I will take your time. And I will teach you as much as possible. A lot of edtechs got angry with me. A lot of companies told me. Let's launch it as a paid course. Do it on our platform. I will not take names. But a lot of companies are angry with me. And they told me. That let's launch it as a paid course. Why are you doing this. You will regret your decision. But hopefully I will not regret my decision. To make this course free. I will earn money from other ways. And I will teach you in this course. That through web development. How you can earn more money. With that said. I will put the source code in the description. Otherwise you can take it from this repository. That's all for now guys. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
