    "text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come, a lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who know nothing. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development.

This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double-click the VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You can read the agreement here quickly. This license applies to... Damages. And after this, I will accept the agreement. You can also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I am the fastest reader in the world. Next. It is important to check both icons here. It is very important to check both icons. Check it. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut on the desktop. Click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this, we will do the next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow, then there is no problem. It will be a little slow to install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally, you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner-friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please, you guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will also be done in it. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will be done in it. Let's set it up here. And show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here, let's set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I have done all this. Next section. After this, next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again, here are some tips. I am telling you. That's it. Your VS Code is here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you guys. That you close it. Yes, you guys close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in Windows. So you can see here. That an option called Open with Code is coming. This option called Open with Code. Helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code. You will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say, Yes, I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes, I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus here. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write it now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s and it will be saved. I will recommend you guys. Go to the file. Enable the auto save option here. So as you type it. You will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type it. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want to save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I would like to do with you guys. Click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor. Mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Check this and close it in settings. Now you don't have to be scared at all. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is it? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this. Now you will simply press ctrl. If you scroll like this. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. What happened in the folder named. Sigma web development course? That this file was made. Index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Assume I make a file named this.txt. I write in it. This is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. You can see. So this folder. And this VS code. Both are running in sync. Okay. Now if I open this file from here. From the notepad. And I show you. My file opened in the notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use the notepad. Because there are some things in VS code. Which the notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I don't want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS code? Which you do not get in the notepad. If I write here. Assume.html. If I hit enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template. Of html. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of html. It came here. We will discuss about it later. You don't get overwhelmed by it. But I want to tell you. How it is beneficial in VS code. Why we did not use the notepad. Why we used VS code. And this feel. We are getting a good feel. The developer feel. The hacker feel. That feel is also important. Then you will get confidence. To do coding. Now for Mac and Linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly similar things are going to happen. For you too. I am using windows. Because I have a windows laptop. I can't use three laptops. Linux, Mac and Windows. I can't use all three at once. So for you. Exactly the same things will be there. In fact, I should say. Similar things will be there. Not exactly the same. Very similar things will be there. Okay. So you can follow along. Very easily. So don't worry at all. I will tell you about some extensions. In a while. And you will enjoy. Using those extensions. And you will also say. It's fun. What did you recommend? But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you. You will enjoy. Before that. I want to tell you. That here. You will click on the right. Click on the command palette. So here. There are a lot of options for VS Code. You don't need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course. Whatever feature. As it comes into use. I will keep telling you. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You don't have to do this. But I will do it. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So you see. I will type anything. If I press caps lock. So here caps lock will be clicked. So you will know. Which button I pressed. Now this thing is for you. Not at all relevant. But I just want to tell you. What is screencast mode? What is screencast mode? We can change its settings from here. Now here you see. Screencast mode. Vertical offset. What does vertical offset mean? If I make vertical offset 0. So it came up. If I make vertical offset 70. So it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here. So it came here. If I make it 80. So it came here. That means. From bottom. How much will it look up? So I made it 0. In fact, I made it 1. Now I will type anything here. Suppose I did this. It will show you at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do is. I will close this this.txt file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like tabs in chrome. Your tabs are exactly the same. So I hope you know. What is it? What we have written now. You will forget about it. I will tell you step by step. What exactly is what? You can also close the welcome page. Of VS Code. By any chance. If you want to zoom in on VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording a video. Now add control plus. Add the plus of numpad. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in. Because I am recording videos. So ideally I would like. That you can see the screen from a distance. But when I am doing my coding. Then I don't zoom in so much. Because you have to keep this thing in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you. How do websites work? A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client. One is server. Who is client? Who is the other? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser. So browser, client, server. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You. All of us. Who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am the client. I will say this to the client. When I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what do I say? I say. From this browser. Please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here. YouTube.com. I say. Give me youtube.com website. I say. Browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to see YouTube. What does the browser say? Do you want YouTube? Take this. So here. I will enter youtube.com. So from the server. He brought youtube.com. Do you understand? From the server. He brought youtube.com. He showed me this screen by parsing. This work happened so soon. Because my internet.com. Internet speed is very fast. It is so less. People are even faster these days. But still. According to my locality. It is very fast. Okay. So with this fast internet speed. Everything is very fast. Okay. So the client sends a request to the server. Through the browser. Browser is the client. That is, my assistant. Whatever I say from the browser. He will do that. Will help me. From the server. To bring this web page. Who is managing the server? Server is being managed. YouTube. YouTube.com. Server is being managed. And inside that server. Some code is written. Which sends me this kind of code. That is, when I write youtube.com. This code came. Now how to convert this code. This work is of the browser. That is, how do I show. This work is of the browser. So the client says to the browser. Hey kid. Give me youtube.com. Browser says. Kid you want youtube.com. Wait. I will ask for youtube.com. YouTube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. That is, a request is sent to the server. Says to the server. Give me youtube.com. The server will give it here. Or will say no. Or will say error. Or will say that the server has been errored. Did not get. Whatever response will be. Ideally which should be 200. There is a response code. 200. With that response. Which is our browser. It comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client. Browser. Server. So the client is with the browser. Browser is with the server. Back to the browser. So this is how this thing works. This thing is a little more important. I tell you once again. When you write google.com. Any website google.com. So the client. Says to the browser. Give me google.com. Browser says. Hey teacher. You want google.com. Wait. I will also bring it from the server. So goes to the server. Browser and google.com. Brings. And gives you. You have google.com. Now with google.com. The server is all. Images. All videos. Whatever things are there. It sends everything. Like this icon. It sends everything. The URL of these icons. Is also written in this code. And that too. The work of the browser. To display us properly. So the server. It sends a whole bundle to the browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle. Showing like this. The work of the browser. Now whatever further interaction. Will do. User. Will do. And the user. Will do. So the user will do the interaction. With this page. Browser. Will give additional request. If I do it rightly. And inspect. And after that. I go to the network. And here I write. Assume. Harry bhai. Okay. Assume I wrote. Harry bhai. So see. So many requests. It sent. For images. And many more. It sent. So as you. Interact. Similarly. More requests. Additionally. Will have to send. To the browser. So in total. You consider it. As a server. And after that. Finally. When the kitchen. Ordered. Back. So what did. This waiter. Which is the work of the browser. That waiter. Saw you. Order again. It may be that. That order. Can't be made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very rare. That you do something. And you did not get it. But it happens. Sometimes. Similarly. Sometimes it happens here too. That error is seen. 404 error. Or then 500 error. Server. Is not working. Such errors. Whenever. You get to see. Then also. You are told. But ideally. 200. Means. Ok. Response. And you get. Such a web page. So you can. Consider it. Like a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com. Slash mail. So if google.com. Slash mail. Available. Then it will show you. And if you write. Code with. Ariya.com. Slash contact. So code with. Ariya.com. Slash contact. If available. Then. Client. Sent a request. Browser. Sent the server. The server. Processed the request. After this. The server. Sent the data. Back to the browser. And whatever data. Browser. Showed the client. Then the client. Did something. Browser. Sent the same request to the server. The server. Sent something. Whatever data. The server. Sent. It came back to the client. Through the browser. And so on. So now you will say. All this is fine. But what is this backend? Because you have a blog. There is a lot of data in the blog. So what will you do? Will you store every web page of the blog separately. Or will you generate that content dynamically? You will generate that content dynamically. I take the example of Google. If I search here. So you can see here. The Google header. These links. This format does not change at all. If I write here. Suppose. Shubham. Okay. Suppose I wrote Shubham here. So as soon as I write Shubham here. Now see. That when. I am writing. I am writing. I am writing. I am writing. I am writing. I am writing. I am writing. I am writing. I am writing. So you can see. When I wrote Harry. I am getting a very similar content. So what does Google do? The backend of the Google server. The backend processes the data. In such a way. That he. Such HTML. For the corresponding query. Send. That is, when I write Shubham. Send this. When I write Harry. Send this. So the process of generating this thing. What system is happening. That is the backend. Now this backend can be Django. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be NodeJS. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. Installation of Polygon HTML, CSS, and JavaScript These are the three languages that are needed If you are making a website Every website needs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript In most of the cases If you use only HTML Then it becomes a basic skeleton of the website After that when you use CSS You can style it Like the way this button looks It is visible only because of CSS Along with that, the way this button is red Or the way this button is curved All of this is happening because of CSS The edges that you see here All of this is happening because of CSS So CSS is about styling a page What color will this button be What will happen by hovering All of this is done through CSS In a way, CSS is the beauty of HTML HTML is the existence The body of any page This is a standard that has been agreed upon If anyone is making a website They will make it in HTML So that the browser makers can understand The job of the browser is to parse the HTML And HTML is a skeleton This is a standard Anyone who will make a website in this world He will make it in HTML He will use the skeleton HTML This is a standard This standard has been made so that everyone Make the same type of pages And if anyone is making a browser Then the same language has to be parsed If as a beginner you have learned 80% HTML Then you are good to go for web development Now some things happen directly from HTML I will write a quick HTML code I am writing HTML code in this way I have used the exclamation mark And I have used the emmet abbreviation You guys don't worry at all How I wrote this code I will write this is HTML And I can open this HTML file directly Something like this And as soon as I open this HTML file directly You see it Something like this will open here I can open it directly by double clicking And it opened But this is not styled at all This HTML file is very basic Now you can run videos directly from HTML I have an HTML file Which I show you With which you can run videos I do one thing I show you this HTML file So that we can show videos in it So there is a video tag in HTML If you hit enter Then whatever video you put in src will be played Like if I put video 1.mp4 here You see VS code automatically showed me This is the benefit of using VS code So you guys see here I will reload it So this video is automatically shown I can play it To play I have to write controls And I will refresh it So I will get the controls to play Now if I put video 2.mp4 here I put video 1 here I have two more videos outside I have some more videos here If I put it here And then I refer them If I put video 2.mp4 instead Then video 2 will be seen I will reload it These were Ben Stokes lookalikes Now if I put video 3 here Suppose I put video 3 here Then my third video will be played So I will reload it And you guys see I can play it So our third video is played I put video 3.mp4 here So I will close it And in the same way we can play video 4 And video 4 is a DJ video In which DJ is played So you guys see So you can make such things By using only html Means you guys don't need to do anything else You can play videos with html You can display images All this can be done with html Now if you want to style it Suppose I want a border on it Or it comes in the background of red color So what do I have to do for it For that I have to use CSS And CSS adds beauty On any website Then comes javascript Which adds interaction For example What will happen when I click on search What will happen when I write code with Harry Like code with HR And here auto complete Why did it come Because a request came here And for this query The results of auto complete came here So all these things happen with javascript We call it client side scripting Means if we want to do scripting In the client here We can do it with javascript This is brain So our website is Beauty with brain I am talking about website Beauty with brain Beauty with CSS And brain with javascript Now javascript helps you guys To make the page dynamic easily Like if you want to change the content Without loading the page Then all this work happens with javascript There are a lot of mosquitoes here Nothing is happening My racket is working Oh my god Like the video When I was in college Someone told me Learn HTML, CSS, Javascript Learn 100% HTML Learn 100% CSS But this is wrong Why wrong Because HTML is only 80% And CSS is only 40-60% And Javascript Learn 50-70% And start web development And make projects And you can move forward In this course I will tell you about chat gpt And web development So stay tuned So never run after perfection With HTML and CSS Don't think that I will do HTML for one year And then CSS for next year And then javascript in third year And then make projects in fourth year So learn HTML, CSS, Javascript Learn 50-70% And make a website And then you will make a website And your experience Will teach you more And you will not even know You have done it perfectly While you are making money And working as a professional web developer So you are earning Along with learning And also improving your skills So don't think That I will make a website Only if I know all HTML tags And all CSS properties And all Javascript I will teach you only that That matters And I don't want you to learn Only for years So I have designed this course So that you learn only what matters And you will learn other things From practice And I will teach you many things In this course In this course We will learn HTML, CSS, Javascript And I will teach you Tricks that you have not heard And I have learned In my career I will tell you in this course I have learned many tricks In my career And I want you to learn All tricks If you have any doubt You can use hashtag doubt And ask your doubt I will try to answer all the doubts I will try To solve your doubts So if you have any question You can use hashtag doubt And please Don't use hashtag doubt In useless questions So that I can Prioritize the reply of hashtag doubt I will try to answer all the doubts As much as I can And you will learn everything So like this course If you have not done That will bring a smile on my face So what is react, nextjs, angular So all these Frameworks Will help you to use javascript HTML, CSS, Javascript Will help you to make this process fast How? We will learn in this course Yes in this course I told you that I will make this course For you From zero to 100 Because you have bought Ticket for sigma web development express I want to give you a good analogy HTML, CSS, Javascript HTML is just like car skeleton And then CSS And internal engine car Is javascript For example Skeleton is HTML And then skin is CSS And brain is Javascript Now I will take you to Forbes.com As soon as you go to Forbes A website has opened Forbes.com is a website Which uses HTML, CSS, Javascript Just like any other website If I click on right click On inspect Inspect element has opened Now you see in head They have used script And to add CSS They have used link I will remove CSS To remove CSS I will simply Clear all style tags By using delete key As soon as I remove all style tags And all link tags As soon as I delete all style sheets See what happened to this page This page looks like this It has only raw HTML What should be the size of the image What kind of images should be there And only raw HTML is written here This is not styled So Forbes.com is like this Without CSS Without CSS, it is only showing raw buttons Raw text Raw links And similarly I can see without Javascript How this website will look If I delete HTML tag of this page Like this I have deleted head It has become a blank page Without HTML Now I will tell you This course was initially Made to be paid But I changed my mood And converted it to free course And I thought I will put it on YouTube So I want you all to be serious Many people have reached out to me To launch this course But I felt that this course should be kept free Because when I was learning web development I can understand When you do not have a good course And you do not have affordability So I can understand And I decided that this is a Sigma web development course And it should be launched absolutely free This course is free But as you will earn crores in the coming time You will give me tea, coffee, parties And all the gifts This is our agreement in this video So when you start earning crores And start earning lakhs after this course Then send me a green leaf Or maybe a red leaf But you have to do this only when you start earning well So just keeping you aside In this video I will tell you How you can earn money After completing this course Because this is also important How to get a job, how to earn money That's also important How I do freelancing, how clients come I will tell you everything A to Z I want to tell you some action items The first action item is You have to access this course's playlist Which I will give you in the description Everyone bookmark that playlist Here press the star button And save it in the playlist Many of you said We will buy it even if the course is paid Thank you so much for all the support And whatever you show me love And trust, it gives me courage But this course is going to be free Now there should not be any technical issues All these videos I am putting In a resolution above 1080p So you should see it very clearly But many people say That the video is in SD 240p, 144p You see the video, you finish your mobile Jio's internet And then you say to me Your videos are not HD Call a municipality So I hope you understood in this video What is request, what is response How do all these websites work We got a basic idea How does client-server interaction happen In the coming videos we will see How the website is made We are going to make our first website in the next video So you should have a lot of excitement Because in the next video Our first website is going to be made And it may be the first website of many of you So access the playlist Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Outro"
