video, we will learn how audio, video and media elements are used in HTML. We saw in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played, how to keep a muted video, and how you can enable and disable the video controls. Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio, how media can be shown in an overall page. So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the video screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 and I will not waste your time by opening open with code by right-clicking. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file, how to put audio, how to put media. So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute and it has some more attributes which I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to you will write here, so if you have video.mp4, it will play. So let's see here, I have put it here with control and I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Now it is a very big video, so what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I do not need to write px. I will only do 555, like in the image, we do not need to write px. Here too we will not need to write px. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, in fact, I do one thing, I do height is equal to 555 so that it becomes smaller. In fact, I make it smaller, I do 255. And you see it came here. Now I play it because I have put control, I can play it. So the thing is that you can play the video like this. Now there are some attributes of the video tag here. It is very simple to use the video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that you have given the controls, so these controls will come to you. You can download it, you can do full screen, you can do mute, you can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is src, so you know that put the video here. The name of the video file is src. This video file can also come from the external URL. You understand that if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else, then I can also put the URL there. It is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can be on your server, it can also come from third party. Now what does the controls do? Adds video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the video of Bhupendra Jogi. That you are getting to see the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically sees what the control add will be in your video, what will not be. Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page is loaded. So if I put autoplay here, So you can see that it is autoplay here. So I will remove autoplay from here. And our next attribute is loop. That is, once our video is played, it will keep looping. Like I show you. So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted, sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here on codewithhari.com, and I demonstrate something like downloading VS Code or something, then I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want that when I record a video, if there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will make a video by scrolling like this, I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute on your website. Then the poster. The poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. If I write here, poster is equal to, and I write download.jpg, then you will see something like this. This is how the poster looks. Then I will play it, then the video will play. So in a way, the thumbnail. You saw the thumbnail of the YouTube video, right? This is exactly the same, this poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. You know that width and height specify the dimension of the video. Like I added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you understood this thing. Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz. So that I don't forget. I will give this to you now. And this is going to be a very fun quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio, SRC comes here and I have to put it in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put it in sachin.mp3. Now see here, I will reload it. And there is no audio here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put src is equal to this. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls, then I will not see the audio. See, now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set the volume of this. I play this audio. Sachin, what is in sachin? Nappusa Sachin. Okay, so this is our audio. If I mute it and run it, then it will not work. I can also increase it further. Nappusa Sachin. Okay, you guys have seen. So this is audio named sachin.mp3. Now what we will do is. We will see some attributes of this audio. You know src. Source of the video file. Okay. Then after this, you know the controls. Play, pause and volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will automatically play it. If I have here. Autoplay. Sachin, what is in sachin? Automatically played. Nappusa Sachin. So what by autoplaying? Our audio has been played automatically. After this, the next attribute is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat it. If I want to loop it. So I have autoplayed it. Now I will loop it. Sachin, what is in sachin? Nappusa Sachin. Once. Sachin, what is in sachin? Second time. Nappusa Sachin. So you saw it was repeated. Means it was saved once. Then it was saved again. Because I had looped the audio. Okay. So you saw this thing. Sachin.mp3 I looped. Means it was played once. Then it was saved. Then it was saved. Okay. Sachin, what is in sachin? Okay. It was being said again and again. Because this mp3 will be played again and again. So there are many cases of this. When you want this mp3 to be repeated. Okay. So if you want your mp3 to be repeated. Then you can use it. Now after this, what will mutate do? It will mute the audio. And definitely you don't want. That by default your audio is mute. In most of the cases. But we will want sometimes. That the audio is muted. And we can tell the user here. Brother, whoever wants to listen, unmute. Sachin, what is it? When do we do this? When there are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios together. You can mute them. The user can play and unmute. And can see. Okay. So you have control in your hand. If you want, you can use this thing. Okay. All in all, this is the thing. So I hope you understood this thing. You must have enjoyed. Now preload. The most confusing attribute. That's why I have explained it on codewithaddy.com. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want the browser to fetch the data. Then you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise you will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. Default value. Preload is equal to metadata. This means that the browser will only preload the metadata. It will preload it. And by doing this, the browser will preload the entire audio. Okay. So preload is equal to auto. If I do this, it will download. And will automatically load. So that whenever the user plays it. Then the audio is saved. Okay. So this is the work of the preload attribute. And this preload attribute is asked a lot in interviews. So you should know. What is the preload attribute? Before moving forward. I want you to share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing that the interest is declining a lot. As we are moving forward in the videos. My request to you is that you like this video. And along with that, as you are forking this repository. You have to star it too. Okay. Your star, your likes, all this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was about audio and video tags. Okay. I have also told you all the attributes here. And you definitely have to use it. I will give you all these images. So that you can try out this thing well. Now many people were asking. Can we use replit? See, I have not used replit in this course. But replit.com is an amazing website. If you want, you can use it on your phone. If you want to run HTML etc. There is also a replit app for iOS. There is also for Android. So you can try it out. Many people are asking. How to do recording on the phone? Replit. But what I want now is VS Code. Which most of the people want to use. Prefer. So I thought why not make videos in VS Code. But I personally use replit a lot. Infact videos also come in replit. The next topic is SVG. Media related. What is SVG? SVG is a format. With which you can create images. Very high graphics vector images. So if you copy. You can basically make a circle in it. So SVG is used exactly the same way. As our IMG tag is used. So see if I put SVG here. So this SVG will come here. So see this circular SVG came here. Video. Audio. SVG. These are inline elements. That's why we are getting to see them in one line. You have seen here. Now what is here. You can save the SVG file separately. You can save the SVG file separately. Like if I write here. That img.svg. And save the content of SVG in it. So if I write it here as img. And I will write img.svg. So you guys see here. That I did not get to see this image. If I write alt here. And write my svg image. So you see here. That my svg image came like this. But I did not get to see SVG. Why did this happen? This happened because the SVG. I write svg file in browser. And whenever you want to see the svg file in the browser. So you will put a declaration above. I will show you. So I wrote here svg file not showing. So here is the answer of stack overflow. Which will tell you. So you have to write this. I will show you. xml. Something like this. You have to add this. It is called namespace declaration. So you have to add this svg. And now you guys see here. This svg is visible. So this thing is very important. And many people in the future. Whenever you make websites. So you will definitely get stuck in this problem. I keep getting stuck. So I am telling you. That the problem in which you will get stuck. I told you before. You didn't get the problem. I told you the problem. That it is coming. And also told you the solution. Next topic is iframes. Iframes is also a very simple thing. That you can embed another website from iframes. In your website. Okay. Like if I want to embed this webpage. So I can do it by using iframes in this way. So see I wrote iframe this. And I will copy this URL. And I will paste it here. And you guys see here. That this website is completely embedded here. In this much iframe. Okay. So you can embed it in this much iframe. But if you want it to be embedded. So you can embed it in this way. I will do one thing. I will increase its height a little. So width is equal to width. Let's say I will make width equal to 122. Height is equal to 444. Okay. Accept it. So see it came like this. Okay. Now definitely it was coming in this width. So it came in this line. But if I increase the width a little. Let's say I increase the width. 322. Okay. So see this. My website is completely embedded here. You see. So you can embed a website. Another use case of iframe is YouTube video. If you want to share YouTube video. And click on embed here. So it will give you an iframe code. And you can start it here in any way. If you want to start at a particular time. So you can do that here. The point at which you will start and share it. That time comes here. I will show you. Wait. Let's say I want to start from here. Okay. Let's say the video starts from here. So what I will do is click on share. After clicking on share, I will click on embed. I will start at 12.19. And I will copy it. See there is a copy button. And I will put it in my code here. So I will comment this iframe. And I will put it in the iframe below. Okay. I will wrap the word. So that you can see the code properly. So now what I will do is. After pasting this. I will show you the document. See this video is embedded here. Okay. So I hope you understood this thing. And. Media is only this much in HTML. Pretty much. Miscellaneous. You will see a lot of things in every topic. But pretty much. That's all about media. Audio, video, media in HTML. That's all. This is what you will use 95% of the time. Now I will give you a quick quiz. And your quick quiz is. Create a website. Which shows videos of different categories. And audios of different categories. You can use. YouTube videos in an iframe. Using YouTube's embedding feature. So what you have to do is. You have to make a website. In which you will get a lot of content. Now you use the video audio tag. And YouTube. Using this share feature. The way I did this YouTube video embed. You can also embed it in the same way. And make a very good website. And show me. If you want you can give me a comment on GitHub. And with that. If you want. You can also tell me the code. You can explain. Do attempt this quiz. And in the comment section. Do write Sigma batch op. Access this playlist. Like the video. Do write Sigma batch op. That's all for this video guys. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thank you."}
